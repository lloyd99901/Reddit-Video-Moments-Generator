# Reddit-Video-Moments-Generator
A script that goes through subreddits, gets a list of some of the videos and downloads them, concatenates them using FFmpeg and (when it's programmed in) posts the result to YouTube.


## Note:
This is an old project that is somewhat buggy and contains many dependencies. This was just a prototype/proof of concept so the code is more sloppy than it should be.
